## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack confirmed: React Native + Expo (not Flutter) — Plaid ships first-party `react-native-plaid-link-sdk`; Flutter path uses community wrapper that lags behind releases
- Auth storage: `expo-secure-store` required (not AsyncStorage) — AsyncStorage tokens appear in unencrypted device backups
- OAuth tokens (Gmail, Plaid): must be stored in Supabase Vault server-side, never on device
- RevenueCat requires Expo Development Build — Expo Go will not work for RevenueCat or Plaid

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Pre-Phase 2] Verify current Supabase Edge Function timeout limit before designing Gmail scan chunking strategy. If under 60 seconds, an external job queue (Inngest, Trigger.dev) may be required.
- [Pre-Phase 2] Verify current Google OAuth verification timeline at https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/9110914 — the 4-8 week estimate is LOW confidence and directly determines whether Gmail ships at launch.
- [Pre-Phase 3] Verify `/transactions/recurring` endpoint is included in your Plaid pricing tier before starting Plaid implementation.
- [Pre-Phase 3] Verify `react-native-plaid-link-sdk` version compatibility with your Expo SDK version before starting.

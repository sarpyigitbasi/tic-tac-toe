## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Social features | Not core to value proposition |
| Desktop app | Mobile + web covers the use case |
| OAuth login (Google/Apple SSO) | Email/password sufficient for v1 |
| Real-time bank sync | Polling on-demand sufficient for v1 |
| Multi-currency | Adds complexity, defer to v2 |
